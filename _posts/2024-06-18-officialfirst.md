Hello!

As I wrap up uploading a few of my academic projects to my public GitHub, I am excited to finally start one of the many things I've been wanting to do for a while: a blog!

This is the first in a series of blog posts detailing my journey to complete LeetCode problems more efficiently. I'll be sharing updates on my progress in strengthening concepts such as data abstraction, algorithms, and data structures at the beginner level.

Over the past month, I've been working on this by reading from a textbook that covers all these topics. The most recent topic I've been studying is operator overloading.

Since this is my first post, I wanted to outline the structure I will be following in future posts for this series. Mainly, I'll ensure that each post includes the topic(s) I worked on that day, along with any issues I encountered or interesting points related to the topic(s).  

Stay tuned for more updates, and happy coding!
