Hello!

For the past few days (up until yesterday), I have been working on uploading some of my academic projects to GitHub, as mentioned in my previous post. Now, I want to start providing updates on my algorithmic problem-solving journey.

I recently finished reading about operator overloading but turns out I already finished reading it before I started uploading those projects and didn't realize it until I reread the section yesterday! Since then, I have moved on to the following sections: "Compiling Large Programs" and "The make Utility".

Before I get into what I will be doing after this post, let me provide a little bit of context. At the end of almost every section, there are exercises for the reader to work on. These exercises usually involve incorporating the learned concepts into classes like `Date`, `ThreeDVectors`, and `Fractions`.

I prefer to read ahead a few sections before stopping to add onto these classes. Currently, I will be working on adding operators like `<<`, `>>`, and `+=` to the aforementioned classes (operator overloading). Afterward, I'll reorganize the code of these classes by following the guidelines provided in the "Compiling Large Programs" section.

There are no exercises for the "The make Utility" section, but there is a very short study question at the end: "What is a Makefile?" which just seems like an automated way of compiling/recompiling files together? With that answer provided, chapter 2 is wrapped up!

Also, just in case I mention this in the future, the book I am reading often uses the class `Time` to demonstrate concepts related to the current section. I'm not sure if this will continue in the later chapters since I'm only on chapter 2.

Stay tuned for more updates, and happy coding!
