# Hello!

Just wanted to provide a brief update on what I've been up to this past week. I gave myself a deadline of one month to finish reading the textbook, which is essentially cramming a three-month course into one month. As the deadline approaches, I have started to feel burned out.

As I wrapped up learning about C-strings, strings, and streams, and moved onto vectors, I decided to take a break from the textbook and try out Neovim. Up until today, I have been completing the end-of-section exercises using VSCode, but I just cannot stand the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

I already had Ubuntu installed on my computer, and as I started my Neovim journey, I ended up corrupting the OS. I decided to wipe the whole HDD it was installed on and continue on an Ubuntu terminal in Windows.

After a few days of dealing with that, I bring you my first post created using the Neovim text editor! :D

stay tuned for my updates, and happy coding!
